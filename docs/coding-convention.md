# Coding convention

- [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- 100 characters line length limit
  - supports of opening two files side by side and a console/file explorer tab on 24" monitor
  - having a small part of word over limit is fine

## Files/directories naming guidelines

- kebab-case for any files and directories: use all-lowercase, and separate words with hyphens
- snake_case for any python source code: use all-lowercase, and separate words with underscore
