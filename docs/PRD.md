# Product Requirements Document

## MVP

ASAP we got the MVP - we go live immediately and start to deploy our platform. In concept of game
dev this stage is called open beta. After reaching this stage we can show our platfrom to close
acquaintances and relatives.

- empty database for storing all data that we will need on this stage
- search by release names and artists names/albums/year/genre
- download tabs in ASCII .txt (our own format)
- sorting by release names and artists names

*Note: by release here are considered release category from our databse, look
[here](db-schema-explanatory.md) for explanation.*

## Release version

The core functionality that stop us from calling our service a solid release candidate. After
reaching this stage at least we are encouraged to share our service via the social channels that we
have.

- sorting by release year/genre name/release type/album kind
- login/password authentication
- store custom songs lists
- store custom sheets/tabs lists
- static rating system statistics (view/download/searched/indexed times)
- full screen mode
- tab editor + editing chain
- tab creator + creation chain
- dark/lite themes
- somehow populated database

## Post-release suggestions

The additional functionality that we can consider to implement. After reaching or during this stage
we can consider starting an advertising company to engage a lot of real users to our service.

- Most likely:
  - print tabs to PDF
  - playing of songs
  - difficulty of song
  - email authentication
  - account recovery service
  - SSO authentication
  - share songs/sheets/tabs via social network
  - share songs/sheets/tabs or even lists to another account
  - editing/upload chains verification mechanism
  - private storage of self-uploaded content without verifications
  - more themes (we definitely need at least another one with anime)
  - customizable UI
  - download tabs in Guitar Pro compatible formats (GP, GPX, GP5, GP4 and GP3)
  - upload tabs in Guitar Pro compatible formats (GP, GPX, GP5, GP4 and GP3)
  - RU localization
  - album/author thumbnails
  - link for youtube video
  - link for itunes/spotify/soundcloud/yandex music
  - mobile app

- Arguable:
  - using microphone to record tabs (we are not an audio recognition service, are we?)
  - using guitar input to record tabs (we are not a recording software, are we?)
  - timed lyrics for songs (we are not a karaoke service, are we?)
  - comments section for tab page (we are not a video hosting service, are we?)
  - forum/message chain for discussions (we are not a social network service, are we?)
  - other localizations (we are not satisfied with ENG/RU one, are we?)
    - the only one language that we know and can add is UA, *seems like what is Ukraine nearabout?*
  - accessibility (we are not invalides, are we?)
