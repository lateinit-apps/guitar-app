# Outcomes of tablature sources research and licensing issues

## Summary

Final recommendation here is to fulfill four conditions:

- developing a non-commercial product
- positioning ourselves as an educative resource
- holding a few database records for real artists and tabs (in order to not regret about flushing out the data on potential copyright agency claim)
- trying to not become a popular portal that will attract lawyers' attention

Cite from Songsterr's Q/A:
> Do you have an API?
> Our licenses with music publishers don't allow us to share tab content in cases like yours.

[Acousterr's](https://www.acousterr.com/terms) may look OK to start with:
> This is a purely user contributed web application. A user may choose to keep
> his tablature private or make it public. The owners of the website/company
> are not responsible for any infringement whatsoever in case any user
> chooses to make a copyrighted content public.

Apart from tablature sources themselves, I wondered is it OK from the copyright law to distribute tabs. Results for my quick research were discouraging. Article for discussion: https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/the_intersection_of_guitar_tabs_and_copyright_law-92973

Quora tab sharing legality answer of the [Fretello](https://fretello.com) CEO:
> I’m in that business for some years now and actually, it’s not legal.
> The rights for the songs and the sheet music are owned by labels such as
> Sony, Universal, Warner or Hal Leonard. Portals like Ultimate Guitar pay a
> huge amount of money so that they are allowed to host tabs online. As long
> as you don’t have a license agreement with the license holder it’s therefore
> forbidden to re-share. While I don’t think you will be sued for hosting a
> single tab on your homepage, I would be very careful with making them
> available online.

[Chordie](https://www.chordie.com) has a quite nifty approach. At the bottom of the tab page you can see the following notice:
> Important: The song above is NOT stored on the Chordie server.
> The original song is hosted at www.azchords.com. Chordie works as a search
> engine and provides on-the-fly formatting. Chordie does not index songs
> against artists'/composers' will.

Anyway, the situation is not that bad, at least for the moment. Yet another excerpt from the [overview on tab sharing services](http://www.genericfairuse.com/2018/06/05/something-in-the-way-online-guitar-tabs-and-copyright-law/):
> Of course, any attempt by the publishing industry or the record industry to
> wholly snuff out unauthorized guitar tabs on the internet is futile. Like most
> digital works, copyright infringement is inevitable to some degree.
> Eliminating it entirely is essentially a game of whack-a-mole. The publishing
> industry therefore focuses its efforts on the biggest fish.
